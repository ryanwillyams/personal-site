      'I dedicated substantial effort to creating an impressive projectâ€”an 8-bit breadboard clock connected to a Raspberry Pi 3. With meticulous attention to detail, I programmed the clock in ARM assembly language, composing over 1000 lines of code. The project involved illuminating lights in an 8-bit format to display the current PST time. It required a combination of hardware and software skills, including proficiency in breadboarding, circuit design, and interfacing with the Raspberry Pi. This undertaking demanded problem-solving abilities, precise execution, and a strong understanding of low-level programming. The project showcases my dedication, technical expertise, and ability to tackle complex challenges in electronics and programming.',
